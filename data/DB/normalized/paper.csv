2,AMC,Practical e-learning,NA,CC BY 4.0,"This paper presents practical issues involved in e-learning at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (FMF), University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. It begins with a short history of e-learning at FMF followed by a discussion about the choice of the open source software (Moodle, svn, wiki platform) as the foundation for the web based learning, about its advantages and disadvantages. We focus on materials that enhance classroom learning, conform to learning standards, and at the same time address the needs of the end users: the students.

Nut graphs can be coalesced with singular graphs at particular vertices or grown into a family of core graphs of larger nullity by adding a vertex at a time.

A basic necessary condition states that a graph containing a 2-leaf spanning tree (that is a Hamiltonian path) cannot be split into more than <em>k</em> + 1 components by deleting <em>k</em> of its vertices. In this paper we consider a more general approach and investigate the connection between the number of spanning tree leaves and two vulnerability parameters namely scattering number sc(<em>G</em>) and cut-asymmetry ca(<em>G</em>). We prove that any spanning tree of a graph <em>G</em> has at least sc(<em>G</em>) + 1 leaves. We also show that if <em>X </em>$\\subset$ <em>V</em> is a maximum cardinality independent set of <em>G </em>= (<em>V</em>, <em>E</em>) such that the elements of <em>X</em> are all leaves of a particular spanning tree then |<em>X</em>| = ca(<em>G</em>) + 1 = |<em>V</em>| − cvc(<em>G</em>), where cvc(<em>G</em>) is the size of a minimum connected vertex cover of <em>G</em>. As a consequence we obtain a new proof for the following results: any spanning tree with independent leaves provides a 2-approximation for both MaximumInternalSpanningTree and MinimumConnectedVertexCover problems. We also consider the opposite point of view by fixing the number of leaves to <em>q</em> and looking for a <em>q</em>-leaf subtree of <em>G</em> that spans a maximum number of vertices. Bermond proved that a 2-connected graph on <em>n</em> vertices always contains a path (a 2-leaf subtree) of length min {n,δ<sub>2</sub>}, where δ<sub>2</sub> is the minimum degree-sum of a 2-element independent set.

21,AMC,The genus crossing number,10.26493/1855-3974.21.157,CC BY 4.0,"<p>Pach and Tóth [PT] introduced a new version of the crossing number parameter, called the degenerate crossing number, by considering proper drawings of a graph in the plane and counting multiple crossing of edges through the same point as a single crossing when all pairwise crossings of edges at that point are transversal. We propose a related parameter, called the genus crossing number, where edges in the drawing need not be represented by simple arcs. This relaxation has two important advantages. First, the genus crossing number is invariant under taking subdivisions of edges and is also a minor-monotone graph invariant. Secondly, it is “computable” in many instances, which is a rare phenomenon in the theory of crossing numbers. These facts follow from the proof that the genus crossing number is indeed equal to the non-orientable genus of the graph. It remains an open question if the genus crossing number can be strictly smaller than the degenerate crossing number of Pach and Tóth. A relation to the minor crossing number introduced by Bokal, Fijavž, and Mohar [BFM] is also discussed.</p><p>[BFM] D. Bokal, G. Fijavž, and B. Mohar, The minor crossing number, <em>SIAM J.

So far, however, no attention has been given to polyominoes whose columns can have either one or two connected components. This little known kind of polyominoes seems not to be manageable as a whole. To obtain solvable models, one needs to introduce some restrictions. This paper is focused on polyominoes with hexagonal cells. The restrictions just mentioned are semi-directedness and an upper bound (say <em>m</em>) on the size of the gap within a column. As the upper bound <em>m</em> grows, the solution of the model tends to break into more and more cases. We computed the area generating functions for <em>m</em> = 1, <em>m</em> = 2 and <em>m</em> = 3. In this paper, the <em>m</em> = 1 and <em>m</em> = 2 models are solved in full detail. To keep the size of the paper within reasonable limits, the result for the <em>m</em> = 3 model is stated without proof. The <em>m</em> = 1, <em>m</em> = 2 and <em>m</em> = 3 models have rational area generating functions, as column-convex polyominoes do. (It is practically sure, although we leave it unproved, that the area generating functions are also rational for <em>m</em> = 4, <em>m</em> = 5, ...)

219,AMC,On regular and equivelar Leonardo polyhedra,10.26493/1855-3974.219.440,CC BY 4.0,"<p>A Leonardo polyhedron is a 2-manifold without boundary, embedded in Euclidean 3-space <strong>E</strong><sup>3</sup>, built up of convex polygons and with the geometric symmetry (or rotation) group of a Platonic solid and of genus <em>g</em> ≥ 2. The polyhedra are named in honour of Leonardo's famous illustrations in [1] (cf. also [2]). Only six combinatorially regular Leonardo polyhedra are known: Coxeter's four regular skew polyhedra, and the polyhedral realizations of the regular maps by Klein of genus 3 and by Fricke and Klein of genus 5. In this paper we construct infinite series of equivelar (i.e. locally regular) Leonardo polyhedra, which share some properties with the regular ones, namely the same Schläfli symbols and related topological structure. So the weaker condition of local regularity allows a much greater variety of symmetric polyhedra.</p><p>[1] L.

A set is said to be <em>transitive</em> if any of its elements is also a subset of it; a set is <em>weakly transitive</em> if any of its elements, unless disjoint from it, is also a subset of it. We interpret such sets as (weakly) extensional acyclic digraphs—that is, acyclic digraphs whose (non-sink) vertices have pairwise different out-neighborhoods—and employ a Markov chain technique already given for acyclic digraphs. We thus propose Markov chain-based algorithms for generating uniformly at random (weakly) extensional acyclic digraphs with a given number of vertices.

Here one maximizes the average distance to the clients. In this paper the mixed case is studied. Clients are represented by a profile, which is a sequence of vertices with repetitions allowed. In a <em>signed</em> profile each element is provided with a sign from {+, −}. Thus one can take into account whether the client prefers the facility (with a + sign) or rejects it (with a − sign).

Various consensus strategies for signed profiles are studied, amongst which Majority, Plurality and Scarcity.

At each end of the iterated 3-prism, there is a 3-cycle whose vertices are 3-valent in <span class=""math""><em>C</em><sub>3</sub>□ <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>. The <em>iterated 3-wheel</em> <span class=""math""><em>W</em><sub>3</sub><sup><em>n</em></sup></span> is obtained by contracting one of these 3-cycles in <span class=""math""><em>C</em><sub>3</sub>□ <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> to a single vertex.

To avoid this, we propose a method of iterative surgery, under which the same vertex is considered a root-vertex in all graphs of the sequence, and in which the successive calculations of genus distributions require only four simultaneous recurrences.

The concept of two-fold isomorphisms, as far as we know, first appeared in Zelinka’s work on isotopies of digraphs and later studied formally by the authors with a greater emphasis on undirected graphs. We then turn our attention to the stability of graphs which have every edge on a triangle, but with the fresh outlook provided by TF-automorphisms. Amongst such graphs are strongly regular graphs with certain parameters. The advantages of this fresh outlook are highlighted when we ultimately present a method of constructing and generating unstable graphs with large diameter having every edge lying on a triangle.

We recall algorithms for finding decompositions of this type that are based on semidefinite programming. The main part of the article investigates how to find such decomposition with <em>rational coefficients</em> if the original polynomial has rational coefficients. We show that the numerical evidence, obtained by the Gram matrix method and semidefinite programming, which is usually an almost feasible point, can be frequently tweaked to obtain an <em>exact certificate</em> using rational numbers. In the presence of Slater points, the Peyrl-Parrilo rounding and projecting method applies. On the other hand, in the absence of strict feasibility, a variant of the facial reduction is proposed to reduce the size of the semidefinite program and to enforce the existence of Slater points. All these methods are implemented in our open source computer algebra package NCSOStools. Throughout the paper many worked out examples are presented to illustrate our results.",2014-11-16T00:00:00Z,AMC,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/editor/submission/518,9,2,243,259,13J30;90C22;08B20;11E25;90C90

The data that determine the lifted group and its action are then conveniently encoded in terms of voltages as well. Along these lines, an algorithm for testing whether the lifted group is a split extension of the group of covering transformations has recently been proposed in the case when the group of covering transformations is solvable. It consists of decomposing the covering into a series of coverings with elementary abelian groups of covering transformations, and inductively solving the problem at every elementary abelian step. Although the explicit construction of the lifted group is not needed, it still involves time and space consuming constructions of certain subgroups in the lifted group at every step except at the final one.</p><p>In this paper, an improved version that completely avoids such constructions is presented. From voltage distribution we first compute the weak action and the factor set that determine the lifted group, and we then carry out the test by extracting the necessary information only from the corresponding weak actions and factor sets at every step.

We use this condition to characterize the Hamiltonian <span class=""math""><em>I</em></span>-graphs, a further generalization of generalized Petersen graphs. The characterization of Hamiltonian <span class=""math""><em>I</em></span>-graphs follows from the fact that one can choose a <span class=""math"">1</span>-factor in any <span class=""math""><em>I</em></span>-graph in such a way that the corresponding associated quartic graph is a graph bundle having a cycle graph as base graph and a fiber and the fundamental factorization of graph bundles playing the role of blue and red factorization.

Studying the normal quotients gives fresh insights into these oriented graphs: in particular we discovered some unexpected ‘cross-overs’ between these graph families when we formed normal quotients. We determine which of these oriented graphs are ‘basic’, in the sense that their only proper normal quotients are degenerate.

To date, attempts to generate families of large circulant graphs of arbitrary degree for a given diameter have concentrated mainly on the diameter 2 case.

In this paper, we continue the study of a game variant of this parameter, recently introduced. The distinguishing game is a game with two players, Gentle and Rascal, with antagonistic goals. This game is played on a graph <span class=""math""><em>H</em></span> with a fixed set of <span class=""math""><em>d</em> ∈ N</span> colors.

Following analogous studies in the literature related to independent sets, dominating sets, and total dominating sets, we study in this paper the class of graphs in which the connected dominating sets can be separated from the other vertex subsets by a linear weight function. More precisely, we say that a graph is connected-domishold if it admits non-negative real weights associated to its vertices such that a set of vertices is a connected dominating set if and only if the sum of the corresponding weights exceeds a certain threshold. We characterize the graphs in this non-hereditary class in terms of a property of the set of minimal cutsets of the graph. We give several characterizations for the hereditary case, that is, when each connected induced subgraph is required to be connected-domishold. The characterization by forbidden induced subgraphs implies that the class properly generalizes two well known classes of chordal graphs, the block graphs and the trivially perfect graphs. Finally, we study certain algorithmic aspects of connected-domishold graphs. Building on connections with minimal cutsets and properties of the derived hypergraphs and Boolean functions, we show that our approach leads to new polynomially solvable cases of the weighted connected dominating set problem.</p>",2019-01-06T00:00:00Z,AMC,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/editor/submission/1330,16,2,487,525,05C69;05C75;05C65;05C85

1748,AMC,Complete regular dessins and skew-morphisms of cyclic groups,10.26493/1855-3974.1748.ebd,CC BY 4.0,"<p>A dessin is a <span class=""math inline"">2</span>-cell embedding of a connected <span class=""math inline"">2</span>-coloured bipartite graph into an orientable closed surface. A dessin is regular if its group of orientation- and colour-preserving automorphisms acts regularly on the edges. In this paper we study regular dessins whose underlying graph is a complete bipartite graph <span class=""math inline""><em>K</em><sub><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></sub></span>, called <span class=""math inline"">(<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>)</span>-complete regular dessins. The purpose is to establish a rather surprising correspondence between <span class=""math inline"">(<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>)</span>-complete regular dessins and pairs of skew-morphisms of cyclic groups. A skew-morphism of a finite group <span class=""math inline""><em>A</em></span> is a bijection <span class=""math inline""><em>φ</em>: <em>A</em> → <em>A</em></span> that satisfies the identity <span class=""math inline""><em>φ</em>(<em>x</em><em>y</em>) = <em>φ</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>φ</em><sup><em>π</em>(<em>x</em>)</sup>(<em>y</em>)</span> for some function <span class=""math inline""><em>π</em>: <em>A</em> → ℤ</span> and fixes the neutral element of <span class=""math inline""><em>A</em></span>.

Finally, we apply the main result to determining all pairs of integers <span class=""math inline""><em>m</em></span> and <span class=""math inline""><em>n</em></span> for which there exists, up to interchange of colours, exactly one isomorphism class of <span class=""math inline"">(<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>)</span>-complete regular dessins.
